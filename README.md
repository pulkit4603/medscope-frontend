# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Then run the following commands:

```npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

Must-have dependencies on your machine:

Node.js + npm/yarn

Needed to install & run Expo CLI + JS deps.

Expo CLI (comes via npx expo â€¦, no global install needed).

Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or 17)

Required for Gradle/Android builds.

Android Studio OR just Android SDK & platform-tools

Android SDK (API level = your projectâ€™s compileSdkVersion).

Android NDK if you have native deps that require it.

Platform-tools (for adb, so your phone/emulator can receive the build).

Gradle (comes bundled with Android Studio or the Gradle wrapper in android/).
